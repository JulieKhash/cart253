Dodge-em "Save the Earth from a meteor" project

This is a simulation of planet Earth and the large meteor that's about to hit Earth in space.
The user can help the Earth to avoid the enemy by moving their mouse cursor to direct the Earth to a safer place.
If both celestial bodies collide, they will explode with a calamitous blast.
