"I like to move it!" project

This is an interactive project that includes 4 different geometric shapes that overlap in the center of the canvas.
The shapes expand/shrink over time. The user can change the color of every shape including the background by dragging
their cursor over canvas. The overall experience should give a hypnotic kind of effect to a user.
