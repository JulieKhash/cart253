# Artistic Statement

"Cosmic Dance" is an interactive multimedia project that allows the user to plunge into the musical narration of the universe. This project is experimental since I've never done anything similar with code before (including sound and 3D), so it took me a little leap of faith to overcome my insecurities and bring the project in line with my technical and artistic potential. What came out is a kind of synthesis of old and new skills, which produced an interesting result.


The program includes my original collage figures, as the main characters who "dance" to the music, have their own personalities and rule their world. They allow the user to look into their realm and interact closely with it.

The 3D space makes the scene more immersive and flexible. The user can control the distance and the position of the objects in the space with their mouse, which, in turn, makes them "feel" influencing the event.

The figures and code-generated geometries respond to the amplitude and frequencies of music using the FFT method. The stage and dancers come to life when user enters, and the music should "breathe life" into the figures.

I like it when the work gives the user certain mystical sensations and turns it into a personal experience. For me, this work serves as a foundation for my future artistic endeavours, and I certainly enjoyed working and learning new things along the way. Thankfully, I had a lot of freedom to express my artistic visions through programming as well!
