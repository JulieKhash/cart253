This is how I do it:

I get rid of the hunger. I take on a philosophy. I bury everyone. I remove myself from myself so that I can hide myself everywhere in the work without having to go over humility. Then I become a machine. It's like an errand that a kid does for his mother or aunt. The world is my girlfriend.
